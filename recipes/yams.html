    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Although there's no rule against making candied yams any time you want,
      there are three times a year when candied yam recipes reach their peak
      popularity: Thanksgiving by far leads the way, with Christmas and Easter
      coming in a distant second and third.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Drain the syrup: This is a key move so your candied yams don't turn out
        runny due to too much liquid in the baking dish. Place the drained yams
        into a medium baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dice the butter: Cut the cold butter into small pieces and distribute
        them evenly over the yams.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the brown sugar: Measure the brown sugar by packing it firmly
        into the measuring cup. Then transfer it to a bowl to break it up and
        make it easier to sprinkle. This is a good opportunity to crush any
        lumps in the brown sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with mini marshmallows: This is where you might use more than the
        amount of marshmallows called for in the recipe, depending on how much
        surface area you're covering. You want them pretty close together so
        they'll make that signature toasted marshmallow topping that
        marshmallow-lovers love.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Because the yams are fully cooked already, what you're really
        doing is heating them up and toasting the marshmallows until they're
        golden and melty.
      </li>
    </ul>
